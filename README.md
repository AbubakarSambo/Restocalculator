This is an Android app i built to calculate a restaurant tip and also provide a means of splitting a bill after a group of people eat together. The Bill splitting activity would ideally have access to the restaurants menu, so that whenever one member of the group puts in what he had from the menu, the app knows that there is a price attached to that item. The app then collates everyones total, and allows everyone to choose their preferred tip option and comes us with a final total bill thereby reducing the hassle of everyone calculating what they need to pay.
